# The Amazing Hypno-Screen

## Warning, Abandonware Ahead!

This app was a circa 2010 submission to the AppStore. It has since been removed due to changes to Appleâ€™s store policies put into place a few years after the initial release - namely the need for regular app updates, which I was unable to keep up with.

## What's this now?

The Amazing Hypno-Screen was a simple toy app that displayed several rotating spiral patterns to mesmerize onlookers. Nothing more, nothing less.

## Target iOS version and phone model

This app was written in Objective-C and built for iPhone generation 3s running iOS 5 or later. If you attempt a build in XCode, please download legacy SDKs to get as close to this version as possible.
